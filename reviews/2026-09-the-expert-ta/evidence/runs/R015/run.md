| | |
|---|---|
| **Run ID** | R015 |
| **Date/time** | 2026-09-10 11:17 |
| **View / sample** | S1 |
| **Page URL / location** | https://dei56mo.theexpertta.com/common/default.aspx |
| **Task / process** | T1 |
| **Modality** | no-vision |
| **Tool** | nvda |
| **Baseline** | B5 |
| **Tester** | Daniel Fontaine (reviewer, NVDA 2026.2); assistant records |
| **Result** | Not set — NV2, NV3, NV4, NV5, NV6, NV7, NV8, NV10 need the reviewer (jaws, B1) |

## Checks (no-vision)

Outcome: pass / fail / partial / n/a — every row must get one before the
run's Result is set. Fails cite observation IDs.

| Check | Outcome | Observations |
|-------|---------|--------------|
| NV1 — Page/view title identifies its purpose | pass | O3 — document.title = "Class Management" (non-empty, specific; the reviewer's NVDA+T confirms wording on the walk) |
| NV2 — Headings and landmarks exist, are hierarchical, and support navigation | | |
| NV3 — Every control announces an accurate name, role, and value/state | | |
| NV4 — Images announce appropriate alternatives; decorative images are silent | | |
| NV5 — Reading order matches the meaning of the visual order | | |
| NV6 — Form fields announce labels and instructions; errors are announced and identified | | |
| NV7 — Dynamic updates (toasts, async results, validation) are announced without stealing focus | | |
| NV8 — Nothing is conveyed only by visual position, shape, or size | | |
| NV9 — Language of the view (and passages) is announced/pronounced from the correct language | pass | O4 — <html lang="en"> present and well-formed (measured; pronunciation of passages is the reviewer's call if any foreign-language content exists) |
| NV10 — Every link's purpose is clear from its link text alone or from its programmatic context (Links list: no bare "click here"/"more", no identical texts pointing to different targets) | | (row added 2026-09-11 by sync-checks — not part of the original session; answer or mark n/a) |
| NV11 — Prerecorded video has audio description or a text media alternative (**n/a** when the view has no video) | n/a | O2 — no <video>, media iframe or embed on the view |
| NV12 — Input errors are identified in text — which field, what is wrong — and the screen reader hears it (submit a form with a missing/invalid value; **n/a** when the view has no validated input) | | (row added 2026-09-14 by sync-checks — not part of the original session; answer or mark n/a) |
**view_probe 2026-09-11:** answered NV11=n/a, NV1=pass, NV9=pass by measurement; facts in `R015-probe.json`.

## Observations

Raw narration captured during the session. One numbered entry per thing
noticed; lifecycle: new → clarified → classified → finding:<ID> or dismissed.

Format:
- O1 [new] (state: which view state): what happened
  - Classified: <check ID> / WCAG <SC> / <severity> → finding <ID> | dismissed: <reason>

- O2 [measured] (state: view as loaded, 2026-09-11 view_probe): no <video>, media iframe or embed on the view
  - Classified: NV11 / WCAG 1.2.3, 1.2.5 / measured → n/a
- O3 [measured] (state: view as loaded, 2026-09-11 view_probe): document.title = "Class Management" (non-empty, specific; the reviewer's NVDA+T confirms wording on the walk)
  - Classified: NV1 / WCAG 2.4.2 / measured → pass
- O4 [measured] (state: view as loaded, 2026-09-11 view_probe): <html lang="en"> present and well-formed (measured; pronunciation of passages is the reviewer's call if any foreign-language content exists)
  - Classified: NV9 / WCAG 3.1.1, 3.1.2 / measured → pass
